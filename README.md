# kquery

This is a jQuery clone I built because I was curious about how it all worked under the hood.

## How to use

Just like how you would use jQuery! These are methods which are currently supported.

- [addClass](https://api.jquery.com/addClass/)
- [append](https://api.jquery.com/append/)
- [children](https://api.jquery.com/children/)
- [css](https://api.jquery.com/css/)
- [first](https://api.jquery.com/first/)
- [last](https://api.jquery.com/last/)
- [get](https://api.jquery.com/get/)
- [hide](https://api.jquery.com/hide/)
- [html](https://api.jquery.com/html/)
- [off](https://api.jquery.com/off/)
- [on](https://api.jquery.com/on/)
- [removeClass](https://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)
- [show](https://api.jquery.com/show/)

## Demo

```js
const $listElements = $("div");
$listElements.hide(); // POOF!
```
